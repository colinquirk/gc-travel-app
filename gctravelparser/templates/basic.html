    Answer the prompts below to the best of your ability. 
    Please avoid using special formatting (bulletpoints, etc) or unusual characters. 
    If your answer involves a highly technical subject, address your response to an audience unfamiliar with your area of study.
    </strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        Question 1: in 400 words or less, describe the importance of this event and why it is relevant to your academic/professional interests. 
        Additionally, please explain the nature of your participation in the event. 
        How will attendance further your academic and/or professional goals? 
        What opportunities does this event provide and how will it enhance your UChicago graduate experience?
    </p>
    <textarea rows="8" cols="100" name="importance"></textarea>
    <p>
        Question 2: The Graduate Council's goal is to build a strong community of scholars from across the University, from which this fund benefits. 
        In 200 words or less, describe how in the months following your attendance you will contribute to the greater UChicago community. 
        This can either tie directly into your event or can instead be general service to your fellow graduate students. 
        Perhaps you will report back to your school, write a post for a website, create educational material, review for the travel fund committee, host a departmental event?
