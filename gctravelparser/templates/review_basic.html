            Question 2: Graduate Council's goal is to build a strong community of scholars from across the University, from which this fund benefits. 
            In 200 words or less, describe how in the months following your attendance you will contribute to the greater UChicago community. 
            This can either tie directly into your event or can instead be general service to your fellow graduate students. 
            (e.g. perhaps you will report back to your school, write a post for a website, create educational material, review for the travel fund committee, host a departmental event)?

            Overall Strength of Application: 
            Please take a moment to decide the overall strength of the application and whether you feel the student has appropriate need for funding. 
            Consider, e.g. if the PI can provide funding if the student does not receive this award, if the cost of the conference and its location are reasonable, and especially if the student will need to pay out of pocket for travel. 
            An applicant with extreme need (4-5) may be a senior student who would have no choice but to pay the cost of attending a US conference out of their own pocket, whereas a low-need (1-2) applicant may be a third-year whose PI can, but doesn’t want to, pay for the student to attend a conference in Portugal.
